                    <blockquote>“Ozaki’s passionate and, sadly, self-destructive legacy remains an act for other Japanese artists to follow.
                    His rebellion tapped the same well of dissatisfaction existing beneath Japanese society’s complacent exterior that more overtly political artists have used as a source of inspiration.
                    But no one has said it quite like this handsome, doomed young man, whose uncompromising stance gives him a unique place in the history of Japanese pop music.”</blockquote>
                    – Steve McClure, Billboard Vol. 107, N 29, 2 July 1995 –
